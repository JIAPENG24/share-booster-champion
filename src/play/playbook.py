"""PLAY-stage strategy entry point; competitors usually edit this file first.

:class:`RoleAssignment` snapshots "who does what" once per tick and stores a
``player_id -> role_name`` mapping that can hold custom roles. :class:`Playbook`
centralizes competitor-overridable PLAY decisions and explicitly registers roles
through :meth:`register_role`.

:class:`DefaultPlaybook` is the template default. It registers the chaser,
supporter, and goalkeeper roles; fixed starting slots use ``ReadySlot`` for
non-PLAY branches. To change tactics, override ``assign_roles``, customize
``select_chaser`` or ``kick_target``, or register a new role after
``super().__init__(kit)``.
